# Webrtc-relay examples

> Open one of the html files from the [examples/frontend](./frontend/) folder in your browser to test any of the backend examples.

The examples folder is organized by language used to write the example backend:

## Golang:
 These examples use this library directly, bypassing gRPC (media stream data is still expected to come from udp:// urls, not grpc)
## Python:
These Python examples use the standalone command version of webrtc-relay and communicate with the relay wholey over gRPC (unix domain sockets in this case, but can work over http/2).
  - Open a terminal at the [python](./python/) folder
  - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run `python3 simple.py` to start the example backend
  - Open the [examples/frontend/simple/peerjsCloudServer.html](./frontend/peerjsCloudServer.html) file in your browser.
## Other:
Any non-golang backend should be written simmilarly to the python examples using the stubs generated by gRPC protoc. To learn how to generate a stub for your backend language, see the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).
You want to compile the webrtc-relay.proto file found at [protobuf/webrtc-relay.proto](../protobuf/webrtc-relay.proto) to your language of choice.

- **Frontend:** The Javascript and HTML that can serve as the user interface on the other end of the relay. (In theory the "frontend" could be some non-browser peerjs implementation on another computer, but that isn't covered here)
